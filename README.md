- ```pip install selenium``` --> Needed to navigate in the web
- ```pip install colorama``` --> Just to improve the UI and to make it more user-friendly
- ```pip install bs4``` --> Needed to establish a connection with the web
- ```pip install pystyle``` --> Just to improve the UI and to make it more user-friendly
- ```pip install requests``` --> Needed to navigate in the web
- Once you've installed everything you can run the script
# Overwiev
Once you've ran the script you'll have to write some text in the cmd.
First of all you'll have to paste the link to the NGL user you want to attack. After that, you'll need to input the number of messages you want to send. (Note that you can also kill the script mid-processing if you made too many requests). Last step is to confirm to start the attack.

**NOTE** It's suggested to use this tool only towards friends and people you know, because to some it could be seen as an act of offense or a form of cyber attack. **Use at your own risk**
